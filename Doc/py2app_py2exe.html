of PyGUI version 2.5, it is no longer necessary to explicitly tell
Py2App or Py2Exe to include the GUI package. Just import the things
that you use, and Py2App and Py2Exe will find them in the usual way.<br><br>However,
Py2Exe does need a small amount of help to find certain modules in
pywin32. A helper module is included in the GUI package to make the
necessary adjustments; all you have to do is import it into your
setup.py script along with py2exe. The imports at the top of your
setup.py script should include the following:<br><br><tt>from distutils.core import setup<br>import GUI.py2exe<br>import py2exe<br></tt><br></body></html>
