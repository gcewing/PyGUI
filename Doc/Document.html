     <p>A Document represents an application data structure that can be stored 
 in a file. It implements standard functionality such as asking the user for
file names and opening and closing files.</p>
     <p>Each Document can have one or more windows associated with it. When the
 last window belonging to a document is closed, the document itself is closed.</p>
     <p>A&nbsp;Document provides support for keeping track of whether it has been
 edited, and asking the user whether to save changes when it is closed.</p>
     <h2>Properties</h2>
     <blockquote>       <dl>
    <dt><tt>needs_saving</tt></dt>

file types.<br><br>
    </dd>
    <dt><tt>title</tt></dt>

    <dd>Document title to be displayed in window headers. The default value 
of this property is derived from the last pathname component of the associated 
file, or if the document is not associated with a file, a title such as "Untitled-<i>n</i>" 
is constructed. Assigning to this property will cause all associated windows 
to update their titles accordingly. &nbsp;</dd>

    <dd><i>Read-only.</i> List of windows associated with this document.<br><br></dd><dt style="font-family: monospace;">page_setup</dt><dd>A <a href="PageSetup.html">PageSetup</a> instance to be used by views having this document attached as a model.</dd>

reading or writing. If false, the file is opened in text mode for
writing, and universal newlines mode for reading.<br>
