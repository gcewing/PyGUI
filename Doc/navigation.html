platforms allow you to use the Tab key to move from one text field to
another within a window. Some (e.g. Gtk, Windows) also allow you to tab
into non-text controls such as buttons and check boxes. Some (e.g.
MacOSX) do not do this by default, but provide a user preference
setting for enabling it.<br><br>By default, PyGUI follows the platform conventions concerning the behaviour of the Tab key, but allows the user to change it.<br><br>On Gtk and Windows, setting the <span style="font-family: monospace;">PYGUI_KEYBOARD_NAVIGATION</span>
environment variable to a true value ("True" or "1") enables tabbing
into all controls, and setting it to a false value ("False" or "0")
disables this.<br><br>On MacOSX, this environment variable is not used,
and the System Preferences settings under Keyboard Shortcuts for tab
key behaviour are always followed.</body></html>
