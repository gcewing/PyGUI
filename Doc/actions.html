An actionproperty specifies an action to perform in response to something done bythe user, e.g. clicking a button.<br> <br> The value of an action property can take any of the following forms:<br> <ul>   <li>A <i>function</i> (or other callable object)</li>   <li>A tuple <tt>(</tt><i>function</i><tt>,</tt> <i>arg</i><tt>,</tt> ...<tt>)</tt></li>   <li>A <i>message name</i> specifying a message to be sent up the message handling hierarchy</li>   <li>A tuple <tt>(</tt><i>message</i><tt>,</tt> <i>arg</i><tt>,</tt> ...<tt>)</tt><br>  </li> </ul> <h2>Invoking actions programmatically</h2>As a general principle, action properties are only triggered in responseto actions performed by the user, not actions performed by the program. Forexample, the <tt>action</tt> property of a CheckBox is triggered when theuser clicks on the check box, but not when the <tt>on</tt> property of thecheck box is assigned to by program code. This makes it easier to set upactions which keep different controls in sync with each other without inadvertentlycreating infinite loops.<br><br>If you do want an action performed in response to program code, you willneed to trigger it explicitly. Corresponding to each action property <tt>xxx_action</tt>there is a method called <tt>do_xxx_action</tt> which invokes the action.For example, here is how you can change the <tt>on</tt> property of a checkbox and trigger the action as though the user had clicked on the control:<br><blockquote><tt>my_checkbox.on = True</tt><br>  <tt>my_checkbox.do_action()</tt><br></blockquote><h2>Overriding actions in subclasses</h2>If you subclass a component and want the subclass to provide an action forone of the superclass's action properties, there are a couple of ways youcan go about it. One is to simply pass a bound method of the subclass asthe initial value of the action property when calling the superclass's __init__method. This is not the best way, however, since it uses up the action slotand precludes the possibility of users of your class using it to furthercustomise the component's behaviour. Worse, if the user doesn't realise theaction slot is already in use and plugs in an action of his own, it willsupplant your subclass's action, which is probably not what you want.<br><br>A better way is to override the <tt>do_action</tt> method for the action.This ensures that users of your class can't inadvertently wipe out your action,and leaves the action property open for further customisation, which youcan allow by calling the superclass's <tt>do_action</tt> method from yours.For example,<br><blockquote><tt>class MyControl(SomeControl):</tt><br>  <br>  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; def do_action(self):</tt><br>  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...do something special here,and then...</tt><br>  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SomeControl.do_action(self) #give user's action a go</tt><br></blockquote><br>---<br><br></body></html>
