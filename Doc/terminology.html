These methods may be overridden in subclasses.</li> </ul> <ul>   <li>An initial value for the property may be supplied in the form of a keyword argument to the class's constructor. These keyword arguments will not normally be listed explicitly in the documentation for the constructor, but you can assume that the names of all the (non-readonly) properties of the class and its superclasses are also acceptable as keyword arguments to its constructor.</li> </ul> <ul>   <li>Classes which support properties have a <tt>set()</tt> method whichaccepts property names as keyword arguments. This can provide a convenientway of setting the values of multiple properties at once.<br>   </li> </ul>   <p>Some properties are <i>read-only</i>, meaning that they cannot be assigned to or given initial values in the constructor. Some are <i>initialize-only</i>, meaning that they can be given initial values in the constructor but not changedafter that. The documentation for each property will make it clear when eitherof these conditions applies.<br> </p> <br></body></html>
