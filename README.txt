Welcome to PyGUI
================

This is an experimental Python GUI framework. The ultimate aim of this
project is to create a GUI package worthy of becoming the standard GUI
for Python -- truly Pythonic, fully documented in Python terms,
implemented on all the major platforms, and, ideally, distributed with
Python itself, so that one may write GUI applications that work with
any Python installation, anywhere.

Three implementations are provided in this version: 

* MacOSX - requires PyObjC
* Linux - requires pygtk
* Windows - requires pywin32 and ctypes

This package is still under development. The basic set of widgets is
more or less complete, and will probably be expanded in the future.

To install it, either do 'python setup.py install' to install it in
your Python site directory, or put the directory containing the GUI
directory on your PYTHONPATH.

To get started with it, have a look at the documentation starting with
Doc/index.html, and the example applications in the Demos directory.
You may also find it instructive to study the programs in the Tests
directory, although some of them are not written in the best style.
