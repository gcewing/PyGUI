# PyGUI

This is a project to develop a cross-platform pythonic GUI API.
The goals of this project are:

* Develop a GUI API that is designed specifically for Python, taking
advantage of Python's unique language features and working smoothly with
Python's data types.

* Provide implementations of the API for the three major platforms (Unix,
Macintosh and Windows) that are small and lightweight, interposing as
little code as possible between the Python application and the
platform's underlying GUI facilities, and not bloating the Python
installations or applications which use them.

* Document the API purely in Python terms, so that the programmer does not
need to read the documentation for another GUI library, in terms of
another language, and translate into Python.
